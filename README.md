# React + Vite

This project uses React with Vite for building a high-performance web application. Below is a detailed overview of the technologies and tools used in the project.

## Overview

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

## Key Features

- **Vite**: A fast and modern frontend build tool.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content on the web.
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactive and dynamic functionalities.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation within the application.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **SweetAlert2**: For elegant alert messages and confirmation dialogs.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to enhance UI/UX.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Folder Structure

```

## Usage

- **Development**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server with HMR.
- **Production Build**: Run `npm run build` to generate a production-ready build.
- **Preview**: Run `npm run preview` to preview the production build locally.

## Backend Integration

- **MongoDB**: Used for storing and managing data.
  - Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas.
  - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```env
    VITE_MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```

- **Express.js**: A lightweight web application framework for creating RESTful APIs.
  - Example API route for fetching data:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/api/data', async (req, res) => {
      const data = await Collection.find();
      res.json(data);
    });
    ```

## Styling

- This project uses plain CSS for styling. Add your styles in the `src/styles` directory and import them into your components.
- Responsive design ensures compatibility across all devices.

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented using React Router.
- **State Management**: Managed via React Context API.
- **User-Friendly Forms**: Includes form validation and error handling.
- **Notifications**: Integrated using SweetAlert2.
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations supported with MongoDB and Express.js.

## Deployment

1. Build the project for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to a hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or your preferred choice.

3. Set up your backend server with the MongoDB connection.
